# Insurance Cost Regression

[![Python checks](https://github.com/PrashantSinghpns/insurance-cost-regression/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PrashantSinghpns/insurance-cost-regression/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Model the relationship between recorded attributes and insurance charges using baseline and non-linear regressors.

## Technical approach

1. Validate the CSV schema and normalize category whitespace and missing values.
2. Reserve an 80/20 holdout with `random_state=42`.
3. Compare Dummy mean, Ridge regression, and Random Forest using training-only cross-validation.
4. Select the winner by mean CV RMSE; refit it on the training partition.
5. Evaluate the selected model once on the test partition, then export the complete preprocessing/model pipeline.

Median imputation and scaling apply to numeric columns. Most-frequent imputation and one-hot encoding apply to categorical columns. `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer` keep learned transformations inside each CV fold. Reports include CV means and standard deviations, row counts, the input SHA-256, feature names, and package versions.

## Input contract

| Field group | Columns |
|---|---|
| Target | charges |
| Numeric features | age, bmi, children |
| Categorical features | sex, smoker, region |

Rows with missing or nonpositive charges are excluded. Decimal BMI and charge values are preserved. This observational benchmark does not establish causal pricing relationships.

The source CSV is not bundled. Use a permitted copy matching [the data contract](data/README.md). Duplicate entities or repeated observations require a group-aware split before using results outside this benchmark.

## Run locally

Use Python 3.11 or 3.12. From the repository root:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt pytest
python train.py --data data/insurance.csv --output-dir artifacts
python -m pytest -q
```

On Windows PowerShell, replace activation with `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`. An external CSV path also works.

Batch inference expects the same feature columns without requiring the target:

```bash
python predict.py --model artifacts/model.joblib --data data/new_records.csv --output artifacts/predictions.csv
```

Only load model artifacts from a trusted source: joblib uses executable serialization. Reuse the package versions recorded by the training report when loading a fitted pipeline.

## Outputs and evaluation

| Output | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `artifacts/model.joblib` | Selected fitted preprocessing and model pipeline |
| `artifacts/metrics.json` | CV comparisons, final holdout metrics, data fingerprint, environment versions |
| `artifacts/predictions.csv` | Batch input records with a prediction column |

Final evaluation includes **MAE, RMSE, and R2**. The raw dataset is unavailable in this checkout, so revised real-data scores are not claimed. Prior reported figures are retained in [the historical record](docs/HISTORICAL_RESULTS.md), with their limitations.

## Repository map

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `train.py` | Input contract, preprocessing, candidate models, training CLI |
| `evaluation.py` | Training-fold selection, final evaluation, export, provenance |
| `predict.py` | Batch inference with the saved pipeline |
| `tests/` | Data contract and evaluation regression checks |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Python 3.11/3.12 checks |

This is a portfolio ML benchmark. It is not a validated production decision service. Further work should use verified data provenance, temporal/group validation where relevant, calibration or error analysis, and performance monitoring.
